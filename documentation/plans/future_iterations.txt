## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### New Executors Architecture
All new executors should follow the established pattern:
```python
class NewExecutor(BaseExecutor):
    def __init__(self, name: str = "new_executor"):
        super().__init__(name)
    
    async def execute(self, context: FlowContext, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> ExecutionResult:
        # Implementation here
        return ExecutionResult(success=True, outputs={"result": result})
```

### Flow Enhancement Pattern
New flow features should be backward compatible:
```yaml
# Enhanced YAML structure
name: "enhanced_flow"
version: "2.0.0"  # Version for new features
config:
  execution:
    mode: "async"
    parallel_execution: true  # NEW FEATURE
    conditional_steps: true   # NEW FEATURE
```

### Testing Strategy
Each new feature requires:
- Unit tests for individual executors
- Integration tests for flow execution
- Performance tests for scalability
- Security tests for authentication features
