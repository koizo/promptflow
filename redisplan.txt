### 2. Scalability
- Distributed execution across multiple app instances
- Concurrent flow management with proper coordination
- Resource optimization through caching

### 3. Observability
- Real-time flow tracking and monitoring
- Execution analytics and performance metrics
- Debugging capabilities with step-by-step visibility

### 4. User Experience
- Async execution for long-running flows
- Progress tracking with status endpoints
- Flow management through REST APIs

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ Ready Infrastructure
- Redis server running in Docker
- StateStore class fully implemented
- Redis configuration in place
- Health monitoring active

### üîÑ Integration Points
- FlowRunner needs StateStore integration
- FlowContext needs flow_id support
- API endpoints need async capabilities
- Error handling needs persistence

### üìù Testing Strategy
1. Test with existing flows (document_analysis, ocr_analysis)
2. Verify backward compatibility with synchronous execution
3. Test failure scenarios and recovery
4. Performance testing with concurrent flows

## üìã CHECKLIST FOR EACH PHASE

### Before Starting Each Phase:
- [ ] Review dependencies and prerequisites
- [ ] Create feature branch for phase
- [ ] Update this plan with any changes
- [ ] Identify test cases for the phase

### During Implementation:
- [ ] Update status in this file
- [ ] Document any issues or blockers
- [ ] Test incrementally
- [ ] Update code comments and documentation

### After Completing Each Phase:
- [ ] Mark phase as complete in this file
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Test integration with existing functionality
- [ ] Update README if needed

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES & CONSIDERATIONS

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing synchronous flows still work
2. **Error Handling**: Redis connection failures should not break flows
3. **Performance**: State persistence should not significantly slow execution
4. **Memory Usage**: Large flow states need efficient serialization
5. **Concurrency**: Multiple instances accessing same flow state

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to in-memory execution if Redis unavailable
2. **Connection Pooling**: Use Redis connection pool for performance
3. **Selective Persistence**: Allow disabling persistence for simple flows
4. **State Compression**: Compress large state objects before storage
5. **Locking Mechanisms**: Use Redis locks for concurrent access control
