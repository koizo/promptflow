    type: "file"
    required: true
  - name: "analysis_prompt"
    type: "string"
    default: "Analyze this document"

steps:
  - name: "extract_text"
    executor: "document_extractor"
    config:
      provider: "langchain"

    outputs:
      - "extracted_text"
      - "metadata"

      model: "{{ inputs.llm_model || 'mistral' }}"
    outputs:
      - "analysis"

  - name: "flow_result"
    value:
      flow: "document_analysis"
